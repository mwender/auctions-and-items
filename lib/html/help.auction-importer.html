	<p style="color: #e00"><strong >NOTE:</strong> The import will process the file in batches of 1 items at a time. During the import DO NOT CLOSE YOUR BROWSER and DO NOT EXIT THIS PAGE.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3>FTP Note:</h3>
<p>When uploading by FTP, DO NOT change the permissions on the files you upload. In addition, also note that images are not imported for items which already exist in an auction. Therefore, if you wish to add images to an already existing auction item, you will need to manually add those images by editing the auction item under "Items &gt; Items".</p>
<h3>Image Naming Note:</h3>
<p><strong>IMAGE NAMING NOTE:</strong> Images for items should be named according to the following format:
<code style="font-size: 14px">LOTNO_n.jpg</code>
<ul>
	<li><code style="font-size: 14px">LOTNO</code> (<em>alphanumeric</em>) - Item lot number</li>
	<li><code style="font-size: 14px">n</code> (<em>number</em>) - image number</li>
	<li>Examples: 101a_1.jpg, 101a_2.jpg, 101a_3.jpg, 102_1.jpg, 102_2.jpg, etc.</li>
</ul></p>
<h3>CSV Export Note:</h3>
<p> When exporting a spreadsheet from Excel, choose "Windows Comma Separated (.csv)" as the file format.</p>
<p><strong>iGavel Online Auctions:</strong> Add a link to any item's corresponding iGavel auction page by adding column called <code>iGavelLotNum</code> (<em>case-sensitive</em>) to your CSV.</p>
<h3>Removed/NO LOT Items:</h3>
<p>Adding <code>NO LOT</code> anywhere in the title of an item will set that item to <code>DRAFT</code> status, thereby removing it from public display.</p>
