<h3>FTP Permissions</h3>
<p>When uploading by FTP, <strong><em>DO NOT</em></strong> change the permissions on the files you upload. In addition, also note that images are not imported for items which already exist in an auction. Therefore, if you wish to add images to an already existing auction item, you will need to manually add those images by editing the auction item under "Items &gt; Items".</p>
